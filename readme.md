This is a space simulator which is to be run in Blender (version 2.76b at the time of this writing). Currently, it is a naive N-body simulator, which will be expanded in the near future as follows:
* Ability to convert Keplerian elements into initial conditions
* Simulation simplification - treating different object relationships as 2- or 3-body problems if certain conditions are met with regards to their spheres of influence etc.
* Addition of satellites with thrust capability
* Addition of solar satellites - with force relative to their angle to an object marked as a luminous object
